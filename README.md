# brahmarsive-pipeline

Weekly B2B pipeline & MQL-health report, sourced from HubSpot.

## What it produces (each run)

- `snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD.json` — the pulled data plus computed metrics.
- `reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — a readable summary: funnel, MQL/SQL ratio,
  deal count & value by stage, alerts, and the miscategorised-lead list.

Each run loads the most recent previous snapshot and shows week-on-week
movement for every metric.

## Scope & rules

- **B2B only.** The funnel is filtered to `customer_type = B2B`. That single
  filter drops B2C, Partner, Vendor, Internal and Partner-B2B contacts.
- **Miscategorised leads** (editable at the top of `pipeline.py`): a contact
  is flagged when sales is clearly working it (`hs_lead_status` ∈ {Qualified,
  Contacted, Attempted to Contact, In Progress, Proposal Request}) but its
  `lifecyclestage` is still only `lead` or `marketingqualifiedlead`.
- **Alerts:** "Qualified to Buy" deals idle 14+ days; the miscategorised count;
  and a funnel-inversion flag when SQL > MQL.

## Running

```bash
# Live: pulls straight from HubSpot using the token.
export HUBSPOT_TOKEN=...        # HubSpot Service key: contacts.read + deals.read
python3 pipeline.py

# Pre-pulled: consume data already fetched from HubSpot (used when direct
# egress to api.hubapi.com is blocked by the run environment's egress policy;
# data is then pulled via the HubSpot MCP tools into raw_input.json).
python3 pipeline.py --input raw_input.json --date YYYY-MM-DD
```

The token is read from the environment and is never printed or committed.

## Schedule

Runs weekly, on the same cadence as the `brahmarsive-ci` competitor-monitoring
routine. Scheduling is managed at the routine/platform level (this repo holds
the logic and the committed outputs).

## Reference maps

Lifecycle and deal-stage internal→label maps live at the top of `pipeline.py`.
Notably `dealstage = appointmentscheduled` is the **"Qualified to Buy"** stage.
